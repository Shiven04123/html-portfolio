<h1> Some good movies watched by Shiven in recent times </h1>
<h2> Top 3 movies according to me </h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. Harry potter franchise</h3>
<p>this is the best franchise movie i have watched till now .. it is really interesting and really fun <br /> no matter how many films come in future this will be my favourite movie franchise of all time <br /> by the way the books are way better than movies ! do read them first if you haven't read them.</p>
<h3>2. The inception </h3>
<p> This was an amazing movie i liked the unique concept of this movie . the story was amazing although it required to think about the plot but still it was an amazing movie .. acting of every actor was also great</p>
<h3>3. The Shutter island</h3>
<p> in the start it seemed really interesting. <br /> The plot revolves around a detective who investigates an island and the patients residing there .. it has an incredible twis which makes you wonder who could have even written such a film.  </p>
